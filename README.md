so after analysing the dataset our focus areas for the next month is based on the following** prouduct lines conclusions**


1-Electronic accessories in the all 3 months it has been consistent with its units sold with slow growth being shown in last month so little focus can drive it up may be more

2-  Fashion accessories has been one of the most profitable items in first 2 months then saw a sudden slump in march we need to focus heavily on fashion to churn more profits 

3-Food and beverages it has also been more consistent in the sales throughout the 3 months i personally wont recommend giving much focus at this point

4-Health and beauty it has been low in sales for almost all in 3 months so its a high priority product line to give focus on and try for 2-3 months to see what the outcome is

5-Home and lifestyle-It has been through the highest of highs to the lowest of lows seems like a volatile product line so must kept on high priority too

6-Sports and travel-Like Home and Lifestyle it has been through a war so its also should be kept on high priority task marked as a volatile product

**FOCUS AREAS-Home and lifestyle,Sports and travel,Fashion,Health and beauty**
